### Project Description

A web-based alarm clock that not only tells time but also helps users wake up effectively by:

    Starting voice reminders 1 hour before the alarm time.

    Playing a random motivational or wake-up message every 5 minutes using browser speech synthesis.

    Allowing users to pause, stop, or reset the alarm for better control.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People keep ignoring their alarms, snoozing them for hours, and blaming the clock. What if the alarm *emotionally guilt-tripped you like your mom*?
