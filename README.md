### Project Description

A quirky, fun alarm clock that starts with a gentle mom-like voice and gets angrier the longer you ignore it. Designed to be uselessly effective at annoying you into waking up!

---

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People keep ignoring their alarms, snoozing them for hours, and blaming the clock. What if the alarm *emotionally guilt-tripped you like your mom*?

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing ‚Äú**Mom Mode**‚Äù ‚Äî an alarm that starts off nice but quickly turns into angry-mom-nagging mode with scolding sound clips, guilt trips, and loud reminders that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wasting your life!‚Äù
